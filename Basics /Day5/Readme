# Dropout in Neural Networks: Classification Problem

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the use of **Dropout**, a regularization technique in neural networks, to tackle overfitting in a classification problem. Dropout randomly "drops" units (neurons) during training to prevent the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons, improving generalization.

## Key Concepts

1. **Dropout**:
   - A regularization method that temporarily removes random neurons during training.
   - Helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's robustness.

2. **Classification Problem**:
   - Focuses on building a neural network to classify data into distinct categories.
