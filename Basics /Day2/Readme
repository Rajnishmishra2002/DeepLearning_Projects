# Hinge Loss Perceptron Project

## Overview
This project contains an implementation of a Perceptron using the Hinge loss function. The Perceptron is a simple yet effective algorithm used for binary classification.

## Files
- **Hinge-loss-perceptron.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for implementing the Perceptron model with Hinge loss.
- **README.md**: This file, provides an overview and description of the project.

## Requirements
To run this code, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and any other required dependencies listed in the notebook.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the cells to understand and execute the code for training and testing the Perceptron model using Hinge loss.

## Purpose
This project aims to demonstrate how Hinge loss can be used in a Perceptron algorithm.
