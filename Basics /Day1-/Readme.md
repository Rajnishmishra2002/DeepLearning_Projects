# **LSTM-Based Next Word Prediction**

This project demonstrates how to use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for next-word prediction.
The model takes a sequence of words as input and predicts the most likely next word in the sequence.
This is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) used for language modeling, autocomplete features, and AI writing assistants.

## **Project Overview**

The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization of text data into sequences of words.
   - Padding sequences to ensure uniform input length.
   - Splitting data into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Embedding Layer**: Maps each word to a dense vector representation.
   - **LSTM Layer**: Captures the temporal dependencies in the input text sequences.
   - **Dense Output Layer**: Uses a softmax activation function to predict the next word from the vocabulary.

3. **Training**:
   - The model is trained on sequences of text data using categorical cross-entropy loss and an Adam optimizer.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given an input sentence fragment, the model predicts the next word based on learned patterns.


## **Dependencies**

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- Python 3.7 or above
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development)


## **Model Summary**

The LSTM model is structured as follows:

| Layer          | Output Shape        | Parameters |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Embedding      | (None, seq_length, embed_dim) | Depends on vocab size and embedding dim |
| LSTM           | (None, lstm_units)  | Calculated automatically |
| Dense          | (None, vocab_size)  | vocab_size Ã— lstm_units |

## **Future Improvements**

- Fine-tune the embedding and LSTM hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Experiment with larger datasets or pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe or Word2Vec).
- Extend the model to generate entire sentences.
