Padding & Strides in Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the concepts of padding and strides in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These fundamental techniques impact the output size, feature extraction, and computational efficiency of convolutional layers.

Overview
The notebook provides:

Theory: Detailed explanations of what padding and strides are, along with their mathematical implications.
Visualizations: Examples to demonstrate how varying padding and stride values affect convolution outputs.
Code Implementation: Python code snippets for implementing padding and strides using popular deep-learning libraries like TensorFlow.
Key Concepts
Padding:

Adds extra pixels (typically zeros) around the input feature map.
Types of padding include:
Valid Padding (no padding).
Same Padding (output size matches input size).
Strides:

Controls the step size of the convolutional filter across the input feature map.
Higher strides reduce the output size.

Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need:

Python 3.7+
