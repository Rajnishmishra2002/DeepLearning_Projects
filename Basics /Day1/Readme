# Basic Perceptron Model for Placement Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple Perceptron model to predict student placement outcomes based on features like CGPA and resume score. The notebook covers the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, train-test split, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: `Basic_Perceptron_To_predict_placement.ipynb`
  - Contains all steps for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Data**: Ensure that the dataset is loaded into the notebook for analysis and model building.

## Key Concepts

- **Perceptron Algorithm**: A linear classifier for binary classification tasks.
- **Train-Test Split**: Divides data into training and testing sets for evaluation.
  - **`random_state=42`**: Sets a seed for reproducibility of the train-test split.
  - **`stratify=y`**: Maintains the class distribution in both the training and test sets.

## Setup

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, feature selection, and train-test splitting.
2. **Model Training**: The Perceptron model is trained on features like CGPA and resume score.
3. **Evaluation**: Model performance is measured using accuracy score and visualized with Seaborn.

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, ensure all dependencies are installed, and launch it using:

```bash
jupyter notebook Basic_Perceptron_To_predict_placement.ipynb
```

## Acknowledgments

This project leverages Scikit-Learn for the Perceptron implementation and data manipulation using Pandas.
