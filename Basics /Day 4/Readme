# Early Stopping in Machine Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates the concept of **Early Stopping**, a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting during model training. It tracks the model's performance on a validation set and halts training when further improvements are unlikely.

## Key Concepts

1. **Early Stopping**:
   - Monitors a validation metric (e.g., loss or accuracy) during training.
   - Stops training once the metric stops improving after a defined patience period.

2. **Benefits**:
   - Prevents overfitting.
   - Saves computational resources by reducing unnecessary training epochs.

## Notebook Highlights

- **Dataset Preparation**: Includes data loading, preprocessing, and splitting into training and validation sets.
- **Model Training**: Implements early stopping with various machine learning frameworks.
- **Evaluation**: Compares model performance with and without early stopping.

## Results

- Demonstrates how early stopping effectively halts training when the model starts to overfit.
- Visualizes training vs. validation loss to highlight the impact.
