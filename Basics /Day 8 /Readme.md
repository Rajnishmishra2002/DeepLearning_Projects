LeNet - A Classic Convolutional Neural Network
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of LeNet, one of the earliest convolutional neural network architectures designed by Yann LeCun in 1989 for handwritten digit recognition.

Overview
LeNet is a foundational model in deep learning, known for its application in recognizing digits from the MNIST dataset. This notebook demonstrates:

The architecture of LeNet.
Implementation using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).
Training and evaluation on a sample dataset.
